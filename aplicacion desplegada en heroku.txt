Hello there.
It is the first time I deploy a machine learning model on internet through Heroku,
This model is about stroke predictions based on four features: Age,hypertension,heart_diseas,
avg_glucose_level. The model  used is a random forest classifier and the feature selection was made 
after some stadistical test and feature engineering.
Check out the model on https://strokemodel.herokuapp.com/ and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
